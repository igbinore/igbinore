Iâ€™m a Cybersecurity Analyst with 3+ years of SOC experience, skilled in threat detection, incident response, and endpoint protection. My background spans hands-on security operations, IAM, cloud security, and backend development.

Iâ€™ve led initiatives like MFA enforcement, phishing simulations that boosted user reporting by 60%, and vulnerability remediation efforts that improved response times by 30%. Iâ€™m proficient with Microsoft Defender, Splunk, Elastic, Entra ID, PowerShell, and cloud platforms like Azure AD and Microsoft 365. Beyond SOC operations, I enjoy working on security automation, building cybersecurity labs, and developing tools to strengthen detection and response capabilities.
